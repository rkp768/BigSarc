# Sarcasm Detection Algorithms
This repo contains the algorithms we have developed for detecting sarcasm in english sentences. A overall description of the algorithms follows.  
1. <b>interjection.py : </b>in this algorithm sarcasm is detected by checking the presence of interjection words in the sentence  
2. <b>pblga.py : </b>in this algorithm we detect the presence of sarcasm by checking the occurance of certain parse trees in the sentence  
If you use any of the code, please cite the following paper :
