# Sarcasm Detection Algorithms
This repo contains the algorithms we have developed for detecting sarcasm in english sentences. A overall description of the algorithms follows.  
1. <b>interjection.py : </b>in this algorithm sarcasm is detected by checking the presence of interjection words in the sentence  
2. <b>pblga.py : </b>in this algorithm we detect the presence of sarcasm by checking the occurance of certain parse trees in the sentence  
3. <b>antonym.py : </b>this algorithm checks the presence of antonym pairs to find sarcasm  
If you use any of the code, please cite the following paper :
